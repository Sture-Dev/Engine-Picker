# Engine-Picker
A small tool for indie devs to help decide what engine is best for your specific needs.

## Why this exists
Choosing a game engine is harder than it sounds.
This tool helps you think through the decision instead of blindly
following trends.

## Disclaimer
This is an opinionated tool, not a rulebook.
But it will give you a nice starting point.
